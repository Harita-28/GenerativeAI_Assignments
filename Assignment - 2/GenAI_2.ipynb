His initial findings are dismissed as an anomaly, a quirk in the data. But Jian's persistence reveals a chilling truth: the planet is on a direct collision course with Earth, and impact is only a decade away.\n",

Governments, preoccupied with their own short-term political agendas, ignore his warnings, focusing on more pressing (and less apocalyptic) issues.  Jian, feeling increasingly isolated and desperate, faces a monumental task: to not only convince a disbelieving world of the impending doom but also to find a way to prevent it, a solution that seems beyond the realm of possibility.\n",

They explore radical solutions—from planetary deflection systems to theoretical physics that may or may not work. The story culminates in a heart-pounding final act, where Jian and his team face an impossible choice: risk a last-ditch, potentially self-destructive attempt to save humanity or resign themselves to the inevitable destruction of Earth. The ending remains ambiguous, highlighting the immense gravity of the situation and the uncertain future of humanity.  The story emphasizes the fragility of life and the potential consequences of ignoring scientific warnings, even when they are difficult to accept.\n",
